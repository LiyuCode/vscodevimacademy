## Help

Copy editing and proofreading the translations will be a big help. Im currently running the the source json through Google Translator and we all know how that will turn out. I can get reliable help on Chinese and Spanish, but I will rely on crowdsourcing for the rest.

Submit issues, feature request on the github page.
